Since I plan to gradually grow this website's design and features, this document lists all major changes done. The format is based on [[https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/][Keep a Changelog]].

* 2024-12-26
- Setup Github Action to publish the website whenever changes are pushed to Github.
- Created .gitignore, build-site.el, build.sh files.
- Created a git repository at Github to host the website.
- Configured ox-publish to convert org documents into html files.
- Created index file. This is the homepage.
